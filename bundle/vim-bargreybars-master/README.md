# bargreybars.vim

Gvim windows have a grey background hidden behind the text area. When maximised their dimensions are not a multiple of the font size, so the background shows up as grey bars on the right and bottom side of the windows.

This plugin keeps the windows background in sync with your color scheme.

Grey bars gone, the world is safe again!

*Note: the plugin works only on Windows*. GTK-based Vim can be [tweaked](http://pastebin.com/N0G333nP) in a different way, and [the issue has been reported](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/349) in the Vim tracker.

## Features

By default, bargreybars.vim runs automatically when you start gvim and when you switch colorscheme. This behaviour can be disabled in your `.vimrc` file with:

``` viml
let g:bargreybars_auto = 0
```

If the automatic color-matching is disabled, you can use the `Colorscheme` command to apply a scheme and match the window background color. It works the same way as the standard `colorscheme` command.

``` viml
:Colorscheme zenburn
```

## Installation

The plugin is compatible with [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and a similar plugin managers.

Here's the clone command for you copy-paste convenience:

```
git clone https://github.com/dreadnaut/vim-bargreybars.git
```

There, no further configuration is needed, you are ready to go.

## Building the dll from source

The plugin relies on a C library that modifies the window attributes. It is heavily inspired by [gvimfullscreen](https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/gvimfullscreen_win32), and compatible with it. Source code for the library is included in the `dll` directory.

The x86 dll in the repository is built with the [Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools). The code also compiles as x64.

Choose your target environment by opening the correct Visual C++ command prompt, then build the dll file with `nmake`, the included batch script, _or_ the command below â€”I like options.

```
cl.exe /LD bargreybars.c Gdi32.lib User32.lib
```
